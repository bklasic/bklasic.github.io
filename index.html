            "I cannot begin to express how lucky we are to have found Brittney.
            I was at the end of the rope with my chestnut mare (enough said) who
            had some significant behavioral issues including regular bucking.
            She had never been properly started and I really needed somebody to
            help us grow together. What I love about Brittney is that she is
            constantly trying new things to see what works best for Bella. She
            rides her first to get her safer for me, and then teaches me the
            skills under saddle that I was lacking. She is also just a very
            enjoyable person to be around. The bucking is fully resolved and the
            progress has been exceptional. I hope we can be lucky enough to keep
            her forever!" <br />- Natasha B.

            "Here we go... <br />My mares and I began training with Brittney
            last October 2020. She comes 4 days a week in which she rides my
            mares and I get lessons twice a week. <br />Brittney is an excellent
            rider. She is able to teach and impact confidence in both horses and
            rider. She stresses safety and correct positioning of the rider. She
            also thrives by exploring different exercises for my mares and
            myself to find balance as well as relaxation in the various
            movements needed in our Dressage training. <br />Brittney is
            extremely conscientious about the horse's need. One of my mares has
            a very "special" temperament and with patience and tact Brittney has
            been able to give her the confidence and relaxation she needs and at
            the game time push her enough to meet her demands in training.
            <br />Brittney is a very supportive and dedicated trainer, always
            conscious of and working with students individual needs. I highly
            recommend her!"<br />
